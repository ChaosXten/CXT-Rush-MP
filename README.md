CXT-Rush-MP
===========

These are the raw mod and config files associated with the CXT Rush modpack. They are the base for the CXT launcher. If you're comfortable with manually modifying your local Minecraft isntance for modpacks you can use the latest version to update your modpack. ONLY use these files if you KNOW what you are doing. Otherwise use the CXT launcher.
